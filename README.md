# Wider Marriage Spot
Enables support for fully-functional marriage spots in larger sizes than the standard 2x1 format.

## Description
Have you ever wanted to set up a wedding and then realized you made the room an odd number of cells wide and there was no way to center the marriage spot? Well now you can have a marriage spot that's 3 cells wide.

This isn't just a resize of the existing marriage spot. The game has a lot of hard-coded behavior that requires both pawns to be directly adjacent to one another in order for the wedding to proceed. I've removed those restrictions using Harmony patching, allowing you to use wider marriage spots where the pawns will actually position themselves appropriately at either end.

## Features
* Adds new marriage spots in 3x1, 4x1, and 5x1 sizes.
* Pawns will position themselves at either end of the marriage spot during the wedding.
* Optional setting for pawns to occupy the center cell of a spot with an odd-numbered width.
* Features similar to those offered by [Barely Better Spots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2875366181) by Owlchemist.
  * Marriage spots can be placed nearly anywhere. Use common sense when placing it.
  * Choose from a selection of textures for your marriage spot, including completely transparent.
    * Requires [Vanilla Expanded Framework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2023507013) for texture selection.
   
## Frequently Asked Questions
### How big can the marriage spots be?
There's technically no limit, but I've only included options for 3x1, 4x1, and 5x1. Anything wider than that and you're venturing into some pretty bizarre territory, but technically there's nothing stopping you from adding even wider ones.
### What about different shapes? Could you add a 3x3 marriage spot?
That could also technically work, but why would you want that? Best case scenario the pawns would be in diagonally opposite corners of the spot. It seems pointless and prone to causing weird behavior, so it's not supported.
### Does this mean I can have polyamorous wedding ceremonies?
Sorry, but that's not something this mod provides. That would be a much larger project that I'm not currently interested in taking on. Romance On The Rim offers something like this and is compatible with this mod.

## Compatibility
### [Romance On The Rim](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/2654432921)
Compatibility patch included which allows its Wedding Ritual to recognize the new marriage spots as valid ritual locations. This mod makes no changes to how Romance On The Rim chooses pawn locations during the Wedding Ritual, so behaviour may be different than the standard marriage ceremony.
